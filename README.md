# Smart_Contract-Interaction-Without_IDE

This lab is aimed to learn developing, compiling, deploying and interacting with contract without IDE. You can use the ethereum network provider (local or testnet) and API library (web3 or ether js) of your choice

## Instructions:
- Create a directory with the name of your choice
- Write a smart with use case of your choice which shoould atleast have: two public functions that are changing state of the contract;
one public read-only or pure function;
one private function;
one event that gets emitted by one of the function (Note: A event can only be emitted by a function that changes changes state of the contract);

- Initialize the repo by running npm -y init
- Add solidity compiler by running npm install --save-dev solc@latest
- Compile the contract using solc that you just installed. Run ./node_modules/.bin/solcjs --bin --abi <path-to-contract-file>
- You will see that two files containing bytecode and abi are generated in the root directory
- Create three node scripts in three seperate files. You can either copy content of these files in those scripts or read these files using fs nodejs library
Create a script to deploy the contract and test it
Create a script to interact with all public functions of deployed contract and test it
Create a script that listens to the event emitted by deployed contract and test it.
